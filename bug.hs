```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs without errors. However, it uses `Data.List.sort`, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). For very large lists, this can become slow.

The issue is that the algorithm uses mergesort. If the input list is almost sorted, using insertion sort would be more efficient.  A more efficient approach would be to use a custom sorting function tailored to the specific data characteristics if they are known.
